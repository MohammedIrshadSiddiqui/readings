# Java and Spring Framework Interview Preparation Guide

## Java Essentials

### Basics:
- Data types, operators, control structures.
- Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.

### Core Concepts:
- Interfaces vs. Abstract Classes.
- Exception handling: Checked vs. Unchecked.
- Generics: Purpose, usage, and type erasure.
- Collections: List, Set, Map (focus on major implementations).
- Streams API: Functional-style operations on collections.

### Concurrency:
- Threads vs. Runnable.
- Synchronization, Locks.
- Concurrent Collections (e.g., ConcurrentHashMap).
- ExecutorService and Thread Pools.
- Futures and Callable.

### Java 8 and Beyond:
- Lambda Expressions.
- Optional class.
- New Date and Time API.
- Interface enhancements: Default and static methods.

## Spring Framework Essentials

### Core Concepts:
- Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IoC).
- Bean Lifecycle.
- ApplicationContext: Role and Usage.

### Spring Boot:
- Auto-configuration and Starters.
- `@SpringBootApplication`, `application.properties`/`application.yml`.
- Bean Customization, Profiles management.

### Data Access:
- Spring Data JPA: Repositories, `@Entity`, `@Transactional`.
- JDBC Template for database operations.

### Web Development:
- `@RestController` and Request Mappings (`@RequestMapping`, etc.).
- Spring MVC workflow.
- Exception Handling: `@ControllerAdvice`, `@ExceptionHandler`.

### Security:
- Configurations for Basic Authentication, OAuth2.
- WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter for security settings.

### Testing:
- `@SpringBootTest` for comprehensive testing.
- `MockMvc` for MVC tests.
- `@DataJpaTest` for testing the data layer.

### Advanced Topics:
- Messaging integration (RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- Caching configurations (Redis, EhCache).
- Reactive Programming with WebFlux.
- Batch Processing with Spring Batch.
- Real-time communication via WebSocket.

### Performance Monitoring:
- Integration with tools like Micrometer or Dynatrace.
- Exploring Spring Boot Actuator.

## Interview Preparation Tips:
- Understand the problem before coding.
- Regularly practice data structures and algorithms.
- Engage in mock interviews.
- Discuss projects comprehensively: roles, technologies, challenges.
